Fourier Synthesize Texture Application
Author: Rollen D'Souza

---------------------------------------------------

This application performs basic timing and memory checks on the GPU for how well it performs 
when using the Fourier Method to generate terrain height maps. Note the functions in this 
program can be easily modified to generate height maps in a predictable manner using any given
seed value. It requires the NVIDIA CUDA 5.0 SDK to build and requires an NVIDIA GPU of atleast
compute capability 1.2 to execute.

The Fourier Method involves:
	1. Forward FFT (using cuFFT)
	2. Applying a 'Pink Noise' Filter (using a CUDA Kernel)
	3. Inverse FFT (using cuFFT)

Here 'Pink Noise' is as defined on Wikipedia. The magnitude of a given frequency is inversely proportional
to a power of that frequency. The best values for the power are around 2.5, although other values can be 
used to customize the 'roughness' of the terrain.

This method is described (along with an extension):
